## Project Structure

The Client, Server, and AC module codes are located in the src directory

The documentation is located in the doc directory. (Only available in Portuguese.)

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies in an isolated manner.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

If you don't already have virtualenv installed, you can install it with the following command:

    pip install virtualenv

Now, create the virtual environment by running the following command:

    virtualenv .venv

After that, activate the environment with:

    source .venv/bin/activate

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project's dependencies using the requirements.txt file.

For that, run the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After installation, all the necessary dependencies will be available to run the project.
